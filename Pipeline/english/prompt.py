Each entry should be labeled as follows:

When identifying questions, look for phrases that typically indicate the need for an image, such as:
- "Refer to the diagram above."
- "Based on the graph shown..."
- "Examine the chart provided."
- "Using the picture provided..."
- "As shown in the map..."
- "Observe the photograph."
- "Consider the plot given."
- "Use the data from the table..."
- "The following visual..."
- "Compare the images provided."

These phrases often signal that visual information is necessary to answer the question correctly. Include only the questions containing such indications in your response.
You are not permitted to alter the original text in the file, even if there are errors in the wording.
